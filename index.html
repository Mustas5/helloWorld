<h1> My beautiful web page </h1>
<p> Hello all, this is my first attempt at creating a web page. I hope to make it at least something you can look at :) </p>
<h2> My Spotify Wrapped 2021 </h2>
<p> So this year I listened to a lot less music than usual - around 8000 minutes which amounts to less than half of what I regularly listen. This happened probably because I watched a lot of YouTube. </p>
<p> As it has been the case for the past few years, my top listened artist was Muse, followed by Santana and the Strokes. I was surprised Pink Floyd came in 4th place. I really like them but didn't feel I jammed to their music that much in 2021. At the solid number 5 I had Gary Clark Jr. You could say he is today's Jimi Hendrix. </p>
<p> The most listened genre was blues rock which makes sense since I really love those electric guitar riffs. I've had some nice surprises in the most listened songs, one example being "White Room" by Cream(it's a good listen). The one that I heard most on repeat was "No One Knows" by Queens of the Stone Age </p>
<p> Well I won't drag this any longer. I hope you enjoyed my brief talk about this year's Spotify Wrapped. Happy holidays to everyone! </p>
